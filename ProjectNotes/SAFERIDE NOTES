SAFERIDE NOTES

schedule based
first come first serve
7-15 during the day
weekdays typically have more messages on weekdays
4 vans
google sheets currently for scheduling "master form"
also have super forms laminated shit
wishlist - student id verification
2-3 vans a night for staffing reasons
only give rides for 3 or less
as many as 5 people
5 minute slots, but dependent upon duration of ride
pick ups and drop offs are within boundaries
boundaries are available online
no records, schedule gets cleared every night
keep tallies of on campus and off campus
if its completely on campus, thats on campus, if either pick up of drop off is off campus
fall/winter Sun-Thurs 6-12 Fri-Sat 6-2
Spring sun-thurs 6-12 Fri-Sat 7-2
obstacle to schedule viewing, the drop off point needs to be close

wishlist: using your location
wishlist: verifying location is in boundaries
wishlist: create efficient scheduling

combine pick ups if they're close enough, and if the drop off locations are pretty close

must complete your first ride before you schedule your ride back
